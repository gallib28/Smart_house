# Smart Home Project

This project aims to create a smart home system to control smart switches (for lights and a water heater) and view IP camera footage via a custom app. The system will be hosted on a Raspberry Pi (RPI) server, providing full control over all devices.

## Project Roadmap

### 1. **Hardware Setup**
#### Tasks:
1. **Purchase Required Equipment:**
   - **Smart Switches:** Wi-Fi/RTSP-compatible switches (e.g., Shelly, Tuya, Sonoff).
   - **IP Camera:** TP-Link Tapo C200 or any RTSP-supported model.
   - **Raspberry Pi:** Version 4 recommended (minimum 4GB RAM).
   - **Accessories:** Stable power supply, 32GB+ microSD card.

2. **Connect Devices:**
   - Connect the switches and camera to the Wi-Fi network.
   - Verify initial control via the manufacturer's app.

3. **Configure Raspberry Pi:**
   - Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite (headless version).
   - Set up network connectivity (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
   - Configure static IP for the RPI.

#### Skills Required:
- Basic networking knowledge.
- Initial OS setup on Raspberry Pi.

### 2. **Raspberry Pi Server Setup**
#### Tasks:
1. **Install Required Software:**
   - **MQTT Server:** Install Mosquitto for switch control.
   - **Web Server:** Use Flask or Nginx for the API and app backend.
   - **Camera Management:** Install MotionEyeOS or ZoneMinder for IP cameras.

2. **Integrate with Smart Switches:**
   - Connect the switches to the MQTT server.
   - Write Python scripts to send MQTT commands (e.g., toggle lights).

3. **Integrate with IP Camera:**
   - Retrieve video stream via RTSP.
   - Test the stream with tools like VLC or ffmpeg.

#### Skills Required:
- Basic knowledge of MQTT protocol.
- Python programming basics.
- Experience with RTSP protocols.

---

### 3. **Backend Development**
#### Tasks:
1. **Build API:**
   - Use Flask or FastAPI to create endpoints.
   - Implement functions:
     - Control switches via MQTT.
     - Display camera video streams (RTSP).

2. **Database Integration:**
   - Install MySQL or SQLite on the RPI.
   - Create a database table to store configurations (e.g., switch states, schedules).

3. **Secure the API:**
   - Add JWT-based authentication for secure access.

#### Skills Required:
- Backend development with Python.
- SQL database management.
- API security best practices.

---

### 4. **Frontend Development**
#### Tasks:
1. **Design the Application:**
   - Create a login page.
   - Design the main dashboard to display switch statuses and camera feeds.

2. **Develop the Frontend:**
   - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Optionally, use a framework like React or Vue.js for advanced UI.

3. **Integrate with Backend:**
   - Send API requests to control switches.
   - Fetch data for camera feeds.

#### Skills Required:
- Frontend development with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- Integration of Frontend with API.

---

### 5. **Testing and Improvements**
#### Tasks:
1. **System Testing:**
   - Verify full control of switches via the app.
   - Ensure smooth video streaming from the cameras.

2. **Bug Fixing and Optimization:**
   - Resolve connectivity or latency issues.
   - Optimize system performance (e.g., caching video streams).

3. **Feature Enhancements:**
   - Add task scheduling for switches.
   - Send notifications (e.g., task reminders or motion alerts).

#### Skills Required:
- Software testing and debugging.
- Performance optimization.

---

### 6. **Deployment and Maintenance**
#### Tasks:
1. **Deployment:**
   - Ensure RPI security (e.g., SSH-only access).
   - Install a UPS to prevent power interruptions.

2. **Usage and Maintenance:**
   - Use the app to manage devices.
   - Update the system as needed.
